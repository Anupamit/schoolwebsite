									<h3>Discovering New Perspectives (DNP)</h3>
									<p>Under the aegis of DNP, The President launched the programme for parent-school partnership in an effort to foster stronger relationship between the school and the home, focusing on the child as the loci of both the parent as well as the school. On regular basis parents are provided with guidance on sensitive issues like - how to study during exams, happy kids, happy you, good eating habits, ‘Weekend with Parents’ for classes Nursery to II focuses on parents spending productive time with their children. The ‘Once Again’ segment of this activity carries a fascinating fact introduced in the week. Through DNP, the school aspires to be a resourceful medium of support to parents through education and empowerment necessary for sound parenting.</p>

									<h3>I Read… I Lead Programme</h3>
									<p>“I Read…. I Lead”, is an active reading programme operational for our dipsites. It provides a wonderful incentive for our student to develop literary skills and ability to read with expression.
										For students of class I, our core idea is of getting hands - on library experience and mastering basic reading skills. This onset the habit of book & news paper reading at the very grassroot of the students.
										For class II - VIII, students select books from the suggested list of books (as per their age and reading interest) and read and maintain a reading record. Various incentives which students of classes II to VIII receive are :
										<ul>
											<li>For 10 books read at the earliest -a special bookmark</li>
											<li>For 20 books in an academic year-a Bronze Reader Badge</li>
											<li>For 3 years Consecutive Bronze Reader-a Silver Badge</li>
											<li>For 5 years Consecutive Silver Reader-a Golden Badge</li>
										</ul>
										Badge holders volunteer in our various reading programmes viz. Book fair, Book Clubs, Library Quiz, and various activities.
